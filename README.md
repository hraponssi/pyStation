# pyStation
### Info

A command line python script for managing mods for World of Warships, helpful for use on platforms not supported by ModStation like Linux.

## Setup

### Initial file setup

To avoid possible issues with distributing wargaming files you will need to manually copy the *.Configuration* file of ModStation into the folder of this script and rename it to *modlist.xml*:

This mod list can be copied from `C:\ProgramData\Wargaming.net\World of Warships ModStation\.Cache\0.11.8.0\.Configuration` replacing 0.11.8.0 with the latest game version. Rename the file to *modlist.xml*.
